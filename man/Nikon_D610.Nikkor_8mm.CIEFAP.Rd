\emph{Figure 1. Photograph of the hemispherical camera system.}

Both geometry and radiometry specs tagged as "simple_method" were obtained
following the methodology described in
\insertCite{Diaz2024;textual}{rcaiman.registry}. Those calibration parameters are the
reported in the publication.

Since the simple method was carried out at f/3.5, a cross-calibration was
employed to obtain the vignetting correction parameters for the other
apertures supported by the lens. The camera was located pointing upwards
under the open sky at dusk and in cloud-free conditions. Without moving the
camera, photographs were taken in aperture priority mode to cover the
available aperture range as quickly as possible. This was done to ensure the
same light conditions as the reference aperture (f/3.5). Fig. 2 shows the
inside-camera relative radiance of the blue band from rings of one degree
width.

fixed at 8 mm, in aperture priority mode.}

Fig. 3 shows the uncorrected normalized data up to 70 degrees of zenith
angle since at low angles mountains and trees obscured the sky. The results
of the cross-calibration was stored in the object.
