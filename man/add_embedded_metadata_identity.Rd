\title{Add an embedded metadata identity signature to an existing registry}
\usage{
add_embedded_metadata_identity(
  registry,
  id,
  namespace,
  rules,
  date = NULL,
  firmware_version = NULL,
  notes = NULL,
  contact_information = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{registry}{\code{hemispherical_camera_registry} object created with
\code{\link[=new_registry]{new_registry()}}.}

\item{id}{character vector of length one. Identifier of the geometry spec.
Must use snake_case (lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores only)}

\item{namespace}{character vector of length one. Lowercase identifier of the
embedded metadata namespace (e.g. "exif", "xmp"). This value is descriptive
and does not trigger any validation at registration time.}

\item{rules}{named list composed of character vectors of length one. Expected
metadata values. Names must correspond to tag names.}

\item{date}{optional \code{\link{Date}} object. Date when the specification was added
to the registry. If \code{NULL}, the current system date is used automatically.}

\item{firmware_version}{optional character vector of length one.
Firmware version of the image acquisition system at the time the
calibration images were acquired. This information is stored for
documentation and traceability purposes.}

\item{notes}{optional character vector of length one. Free-form notes
providing context, scope, assumptions, or references relevant to this
specification (e.g. publications).}

\item{contact_information}{optional character vector of length one. Contact
information for the specification maintainer or responsible person.}
}
\value{
A \code{hemispherical_camera_registry} object with the embedded metadata identity appended.
}
\description{
Add an identity signature describing the expected
metadata signatures of image files produced by a given instrumental
system.
}
\details{
An embedded metadata identity signature defines an expected metadata signature
associated with image files produced by a given instrumental system.

For a conceptual overview of registry structure, see
\link{hemispherical_camera_registry}.

An embedded metadata identity consists of a declarative set of metadata
tag–value pairs (\code{rules}) that may
later be evaluated against the metadata of a given image.

This function does not perform any validation or matching. It only
registers the metadata expectations required to assess compatibility
at a later stage. Their role is to support traceability, reproducibility,
and automated consistency checks.
