\usage{
add_radiometry_spec(
  registry,
  geometry_id,
  id,
  type = "vignetting",
  scheme,
  model_type,
  parameters,
  date = NULL,
  notes = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{registry}{\code{hemispherical_camera_registry} object created with
\code{\link[=new_registry]{new_registry()}} and containing the geometry specification identified by
\code{geometry_id}.}

\item{geometry_id}{character vector of length one. Identifier of the geometry
specification to which the radiometry spec will be attached.}

\item{id}{character vector of length one. Identifier of the radiometry spec.
Must use snake_case (lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores only)}

\item{type}{character vector of length one. Type of radiometric correction.
#'   Only "vignetting" is currently supported.}

\item{scheme}{character vector of length one. Calibration scheme defining
the modeling assumptions used by the core for radiometric correction.
The selected scheme determines the effective form of the model and the
constraints (if any) applied to its parameters. Recognized schemes
currently implemented in \code{rcaiman}: \code{"simple"} and \code{"free_form"}.}

\item{model_type}{character vector of length one. Model type used to develop a
radiometric correction. Only \code{"polynomial"} is currently implemented in
\code{rcaiman}.}

\item{parameters}{A named list of model parameters. Model parameters defining
the radiometric correction, following the conventions of the selected
\code{model_type}. List names must be coercible to numeric values representing
f-numbers.}

\item{date}{optional \code{\link{Date}} object. Date when the specification was added
to the registry. If \code{NULL}, the current system date is used automatically.}

\item{notes}{optional character vector of length one. Free-form notes
providing context, scope, assumptions, or references relevant to this
specification (e.g. publications).}

\item{contact_information}{optional character vector of length one. Contact
information for the specification maintainer or responsible person.}
}
\value{
A \code{hemispherical_camera_registry} object with the radiometry specification
appended to the selected geometry specification.
}
\description{
Add a radiometry specification to an existing geometry
specification in a hemispherical camera registry.
}
\details{
Radiometry specifications intentionally separate \emph{parameter values} from
\emph{model shape}. The \code{scheme} and \code{model_type} arguments provide the semantic
context required by \code{rcaiman} to interpret those parameters and apply the
corresponding correction.

This design is deliberate. The effective mathematical model applied to images
is defined by the functions that consume the registry (e.g.
\code{\link[rcaiman:correct_vignetting]{rcaiman::correct_vignetting()}}), not by the registry itself. The registry
stores parameter values together with the minimal semantic information
required for their correct interpretation.
