\title{Add a file identity signature to an existing registry}
\usage{
add_file_identity(
  registry,
  id,
  extension,
  filename_pattern = NULL,
  date = NULL,
  notes = NULL,
  contact_information = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{registry}{\code{hemispherical_camera_registry} object created with
\code{\link[=new_registry]{new_registry()}}.}

\item{id}{character vector of length one. Identifier of the geometry spec.
Must use snake_case (lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores only)}

\item{extension}{character vector of length one. Expected file extension
(e.g. "CR2", "NEF", "DNG").}

\item{filename_pattern}{optional character vector of length one. Expected
filename structure \emph{excluding the file extension}, typically expressed as a
regular expression describing the default camera-generated basename. (e.g.
\code{"^IMG_[0-9]{4}$"} matches basenames such as \code{IMG_0001},
\code{IMG_0234})}

\item{date}{optional \code{\link{Date}} object. Date when the specification was added
to the registry. If \code{NULL}, the current system date is used automatically.}

\item{notes}{optional character vector of length one. Free-form notes
providing context, scope, assumptions, or references relevant to this
specification (e.g. publications).}

\item{contact_information}{optional character vector of length one. Contact
information for the specification maintainer or responsible person.}
}
\value{
A \code{hemispherical_camera_registry} object with the file identity appended.
}
\description{
Add a file-based identity signature describing the expected external
properties of image files produced by a given instrumental system.
}
\details{
A file identity defines expected \emph{file-level properties} of image files
as digital artifacts produced by an acquisition system, independently
of their embedded metadata.

For a conceptual overview of registry structure, see
\link{hemispherical_camera_registry}.

File identities are intended to capture stable conventions imposed by
acquisition systems, such as file extensions or default filename patterns.

This function does not perform any validation or matching. It only
registers declarative expectations that may later be used to support
traceability, reproducibility, or automated consistency checks.
