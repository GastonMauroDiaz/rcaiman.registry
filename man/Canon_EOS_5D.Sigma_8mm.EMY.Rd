\details{
Centre coordinates were estimated from PGM files obtained via CR2
conversion using the open-source software
\href{https://dechifro.org/dcraw/}{DCRaw by Dave Coffin} with the command:

\preformatted{dcraw -4 -D}

Image dimensions reported by different software are not identical:

\itemize{
\item EXIF metadata: 4368 × 2912
\item dcraw:
\itemize{
\item Full size: 4476 × 2954
\item Image size: 4386 × 2920
\item Output size: 4386 × 2920
}
\item rawpy: Full size 4476 × 2954
}

Centre coordinates derived from PGM images (4386 × 2920) were adjusted to
match the full raw sensor dimensions (4476 × 2954) used by \pkg{rcaiman}.

The \code{zenith_colrow} argument incorporates this offset and its
rescaling by a factor of two to ensure compatibility with the spectral
bands obtained after the subsampling procedure described in
\insertCite{Lang2010;textual}{rcaiman.registry} and adopted in \pkg{rcaiman}.

The original distortion model was defined in absolute pixel units
\insertCite{Lang2010}{rcaiman.registry}. For integration into \pkg{rcaiman},
the model was reformulated in terms of relative radius, with the intercept
removed and coefficients normalized with respect to the horizon radius.

The residual standard error of the fitted model was 0.001746 (47 degrees of
freedom). The model evaluates to approximately \code{1} at a zenith angle of 90
deg, consistent with normalization to the horizon radius. The formulation has
been tested within \pkg{rcaiman}.
