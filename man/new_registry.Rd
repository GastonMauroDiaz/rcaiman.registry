\description{
Construct a registry object describing a hemispherical camera system and its
physical components (camera body, device, lens, and/or auxiliary lens).
}
\details{
A hemispherical camera registry represents a \emph{physical acquisition system}
rather than a single device. Depending on the configuration, the system may
correspond to typical acquisition setups such as:

\itemize{
\item a reflex or mirrorless camera body with an interchangeable lens,
\item a compact camera (camera body with a fixed lens) with an auxiliary lens,
\item an image acquisition device with or without an auxiliary hemispherical lens.
}

For this reason, information related to camera bodies, devices, lenses, and
auxiliary lenses is stored internally as separate components, each with its
own identity (model, manufacturer, serial number).
