\title{Instrument registry}
\description{
Objects of class \code{hemispherical_camera_registry} represent instrument
specifications and calibration records used by the rcaiman ecosystem. They
are intended to store instrument metadata and one or more calibrations,
together with soft metadata describing provenance.
}
\details{
This is an S3 class implemented as a named list. Its purpose is to make
explicit, inspectable, and auditable the geometric and radiometric
assumptions applied during canopy image preprocessing.

The registry may contain multiple calibrations for the same instrument.
Metadata is intended to provide the information needed to decide which to
choose, or a reference to where to find such information.
}
\section{Minimum operational contract}{

A \code{hemispherical_camera_registry} object must provide enough information to:
\itemize{
\item map pixel radius to zenith angle,
\item identify the optical center,
\item define the usable image radius,
\item correct radiometric attenuation (vignetting).
}
}

\section{Structure}{

The object is a named list with at least two elements:
\describe{
\item{instrument_metadata}{List describing the physical instrument and its provenance.}
\item{calibrations}{Named list of calibration records, each with metadata,
geometry specifications and associated optional radiometry specifications.}
}
}
