\title{Instrument registry}
\description{
Objects of class \code{hemispherical_camera_registry} describe instrument
specifications used by rcaiman. They store instrument metadata together with
identity signatures and geometric and radiometric specifications that define
how canopy images are identified, interpreted, and processed.
}
\details{
This is an S3 class implemented as a named list. Its purpose is to make
explicit, inspectable, and auditable the geometric, radiometric, and
identity-related assumptions applied during canopy image preprocessing.

Within a registry entry, three distinct but related descriptive domains are
represented:
\itemize{
\item instrument metadata, which describes the physical acquisition system
as a real-world object,
\item file identity, which describes image files
as observed externally (e.g. filename structure, extension), and
\item metadata identity, which describes image files as inferred from their
embedded metadata.
}

These domains are intentionally separated. A physical instrument exists
independently of any particular file; EXIF metadata exists only as a trace
left by an acquisition event; and file-level properties describe how image
data are materialized as files by the acquisition system.

A registry must contain one instrument metadata entry, which defines the
physical acquisition system. But, for all other domains multiple entries area
allowed, reflecting, for example, changes in firmware, acquisition settings,
or calibration procedures.

Objects stored in a registry are assumed to be technically valid.
}
\section{Structure}{

The object is a named list with at least one mandatory element:
\describe{
\item{instrument_metadata}{List describing the physical acquisition
system and its provenance.}
}

All additional elements correspond to specifications associated with that
instrument, such as geometry specifications, EXIF identities, or file
identities. Geometry specifications may include nested radiometry
specifications.
